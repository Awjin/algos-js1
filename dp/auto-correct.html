      <h1>Auto-Correct: A Real-World Application</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
	Autocorrect is a ubiquitous software feature, whether it be on the web,
	cellphones, or desktop. So it might come as a surprise that this feature
	uses a DP algorithm, called the Levenshtein distance.
      </p>
      <p>
	The Levenshtein distance is defined as the number of single-character
	edits (insertion, removal, or deletion) that are needed to change one
	string into another. For example, the Levenshtein distance between
	“sick” and “sock” is 1.
      </p>
      <p>
	At a very high-level, autocorrect works by comparing your inputted
	string to strings in a dictionary, and finding the smallest Levenshtein
	distance to figure out which word in the dictionary you were most likely
	to have misspelled. Of course, other tools like context awareness are
	used, but this is the barebones feature.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Levenshtein Distance</h2>
      <p>
	Say we are given two strings, A and B, with lengths i and j,
	respectively. The Levenshtein distance algorithm is recursively defined
	as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
	In English:
      </p>
      <ol>
	<li>
	  We look at the strings starting from their ends (indexing into them
	  with i and j), and work our way backwards.
	</li>
	<li>
	  The base case occurs when we reach the beginning of either string
	  (let’s call it “bottoming out”). Say that we want to turn string A to
	  B, but bottom out on A first. To complete the transformation, we need
	  to prepend the remaining length of B to A. The number of edits in the
	  base case, then, is the difference in length of the two strings.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Otherwise, we try to either insert, remove, or delete a
	  character. Whichever yields the minimum Levenshtein distance at that
	  iteration, we take. Since the subproblems are recursively defined, we
	  are guaranteed that picking the minimum Levenshtein distance in this
	  step will help us get the minimum Levenshtein distance overall.
	</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
	It’s apparent that we are going to analyze the cost of every insertion,
	removal, or deletion. In other words, we are going to have to solve
	every subproblem in the space. This sounds familiar&mdash;tabulation!
	Even though the algorithm was recursively defined, since we need the
	values of all subproblems anyway, we should implement the algorithm
	using tabulation. Here is what the subproblem space looks like, once the
	algorithm runs.

            } else {  // Otherwise take whichever edit give min distance
                d[i][j] = Math.min(d[i-1][j] + 1,
                                   d[i][j-1] + 1, 
                                   d[i-1][j-1] + 1);
